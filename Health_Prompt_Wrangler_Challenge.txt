🤖 The Prompt Wrangler
A 1-Hour LLM Tuning Challenge
For AI-curious devs, engineers, and prompt whisperers.
🧠 The Situation
You’re the newest AI engineer on a fast-moving DME healthcare team. Doctors are sending in messy clinical notes like:“Patient needs a CPAP with full face mask and humidifier. AHI > 20. Ordered by Dr. Cameron.”
Your mission: extract structured data using an LLM, and build a mini tool to help you experiment with prompt tuning.
⏱️ The Challenge (Timebox: 1 Hour)
Build a lightweight tool (web or CLI) that lets a user:
🧠 Input a system + user prompt
🧾 Paste a sample input text
🛠️ Tweak a few model parameters (e.g., temperature, max_tokens)
🤖 Send it to the LLM
📤 Display the structured output
📊 Show token usage + response time
That’s it — no extra polish needed. Focus on functionality and clarity.
🔍 Input Examples
Use these sample texts and try to extract structured data using your prompt.
Input Text:Patient requires a full face CPAP mask with humidifier due to AHI > 20. Ordered by Dr. Cameron.Target Output:json{  "device": "CPAP",  "mask_type": "full face",  "add_ons": ["humidifier"],  "qualifier": "AHI > 20",  "ordering_provider": "Dr. Cameron"}
Input Text:Patient diagnosed with COPD, SpO2 measured at 87% on room air. Needs portable oxygen concentrator for use during exertion and sleep. Dr. Chase signed the order.Target Output:json{  "device": "portable oxygen concentrator",  "diagnosis": "COPD",  "SpO2": "87%",  "usage": ["exertion", "sleep"],  "ordering_provider": "Dr. Chase"}
Input Text:Patient has MS with significant mobility issues. Recommended a lightweight manual wheelchair with elevating leg rests. Ordered by Dr. Taub.Target Output:json{  "device": "manual wheelchair",  "type": "lightweight",  "features": ["elevating leg rests"],  "diagnosis": "MS",  "ordering_provider": "Dr. Taub"}
Input Text:Asthma diagnosis confirmed. Prescribing nebulizer with mouthpiece and tubing. Dr. Foreman completed the documentation.Target Output:json{  "device": "nebulizer",  "accessories": ["mouthpiece", "tubing"],  "diagnosis": "Asthma",  "ordering_provider": "Dr. Foreman"}
Input Text:Patient is non-ambulatory and requires hospital bed with trapeze bar and side rails. Diagnosis: late-stage ALS. Order submitted by Dr. Cuddy.Target Output:json{  "device": "hospital bed",  "features": ["trapeze bar", "side rails"],  "diagnosis": "ALS",  "mobility_status": "non-ambulatory",  "ordering_provider": "Dr. Cuddy"}
Input Text:CPAP supplies requested. Full face mask with headgear and filters. Patient has been compliant. Ordered by Dr. House.Target Output:json{  "product": "CPAP supplies",  "components": ["full face mask", "headgear", "filters"],  "compliance_status": "compliant",  "ordering_provider": "Dr. House"}
